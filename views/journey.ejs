                  <p class="timeline-event">When I was around 11 or 12 years old, I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I grew up 😕. So, I talked to my dad about it. He told me about different job options, and one that caught my interest was IT—working with computers and technology 💻.

                    I got really curious about it and started learning more on my own. Back then, I used to play a lot of mobile games 🎮, which got me interested in making games myself. I watched a ton of YouTube videos, like around 20 every day 📺, to learn about it. But I found out that making games was quite hard, especially for someone just starting out.
                    
                    I talked to an experienced developer for advice, and they suggested that I start with web development—it's a bit easier to begin with, they said. So, I took their advice and spent two months learning about web development. It might sound funny, but I actually learned a lot in that short time 📚, and even got certificates from contests and free courses to show my progress 🏆.
                    
                    After that, I wanted to dive even deeper into web development. Since then, I've been working really hard to understand everything I can in this field 💪. And that's my amazing story! 🌟</p>
